llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.7)
messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
    HumanMessage(content="Tell me a joke about AI.")
]
response = llm.invoke(messages)
print(response.content)
```

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# Load and split your document
loader = TextLoader("data.txt")
documents = loader.load()
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
splits = splitter.split_documents(documents)

# Create vector store
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(splits, embeddings)

# Create QA chain
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3}),
    return_source_documents=True
)

response = qa_chain({"query": "What is the main topic?"})
print(response["result"])
```

from langchain.tools import tool
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

@tool
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    return f"The weather in {location} is sunny."

tools = [get_weather]
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful assistant."),
    ("human", "{input}")
])

agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

result = agent_executor.invoke({"input": "What's the weather in Paris?"})
print(result["output"])
```

# LCEL makes chain composition simple with the pipe operator
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("tell me a short joke about {topic}")
model = ChatOpenAI()
output_parser = StrOutputParser()

# The magic of LCEL: pipe operator for composition
chain = prompt | model | output_parser

result = chain.invoke({"topic": "programming"})
print(result)
```

# Define a function with Pydantic
class WeatherSearch(BaseModel):
    """Call this with an airport code to get the weather at that airport"""
    airport_code: str = Field(description="airport code to get weather for")

# Convert to OpenAI function
weather_function = convert_pydantic_to_openai_function(WeatherSearch)

# Bind to model
model = ChatOpenAI()
model_with_function = model.bind(functions=[weather_function])

# Use the function
response = model_with_function.invoke("what is the weather in SF?")
print(response)
```

    """Tag the piece of text with particular info."""
    sentiment: str = Field(description="sentiment of text")
    language: str = Field(description="language of text")

# Convert to function and use
tagging_function = convert_pydantic_to_openai_function(Tagging)
model = ChatOpenAI()
model_with_function = model.bind(functions=[tagging_function])
